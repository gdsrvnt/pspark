## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-09

### Added

- A `spark.json` array of records. Each record has type `SPARK`, a question, an answer, and a 16-character id.
- `spark_id.py`, which checks those ids and unions loaded records with `connect`.
- `spark.schema.json`, which checks the shape of the array.
- `bin/spark`, a placeholder that exits 0 and writes nothing.
- `SKILL.md`, an agent framing skill that also uses the name SPARK.
- Learning playbooks under `.cursor/skills/spark`.
- A GitHub Actions workflow that checks ids and the schema on push and on pull request.
