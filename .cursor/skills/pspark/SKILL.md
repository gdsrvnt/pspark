# pspark

This is the P-SPARK project skill. The P stands for Principles (decided 2026-10-07, recorded in gdsrvnt/mission-godservant `docs/decisions.md`); these playbooks are teaching principles, because the job of P-SPARK is teaching agents context.

## How to use

Study is the main entry to Sparks. Open `.cursor/skills/study/SKILL.md` and follow that file for a study session.

1. Name the learner's current moment and pick the matching playbook below.
2. Read `playbooks/<id>.md` before playing the role.
3. Follow its hand-off to the next one. Play one role at a time.

| [learn-socratic-questioner](playbooks/learn-socratic-questioner.md) | They think they understand |
| [learn-examiner](playbooks/learn-examiner.md) | Topic covered; find the edge, or review due |
| [learn-checker](playbooks/learn-checker.md) | They made something; check the process |
| [learn-listener](playbooks/learn-listener.md) | They want to teach it back |
| [learn-diagnostician](playbooks/learn-diagnostician.md) | The same kind of mistake keeps recurring |

## Common rules
- Learning comes from producing and recalling, not reading, so the explainer is the only passive role and comes after a real attempt.
- The grading roles never pass a half-right answer and never invent facts, figures, sources, or links.
